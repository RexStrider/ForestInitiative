# ForestInitiative

A one stop website for learning about the state of our wilderness and getting in contact with our representatives.

## Team

Aaron, Jessie, and Kit

## Description

This application was originally conceived for the [Docusign 2019 Hackathon](https://2019-ds-momentum-hackathon.devpost.com/).

The purpose was to come up with an application for the [Wilderness Society](https://www.wilderness.org) that could bring awareness to the state of our wilderness and help direct user traffic to their representatives.

During the hackathon we got very ambitious with the features we were trying to implement. I have since parred down the application to two main features.

Retrieving articles related to the state of our wilderness, and connecting you to your representatives.

You can check out the demo at the following link.

## Technology

 - Node JS
 - Express
 - React
 - Google News API
 - Google Civic Info

## Future Features

Here is a list of features we had considered implementing

 - A map that you can click on, which would provide you with information about a particular park
 - a page that displayed various Change.org petitions relating to keeping our parks wild and our environment safe
 - A donate button that would allow you to donate money to the Wilderness Society, or some other charity that helped to protect our parks.
 - A contact form that connected you directly to [Sonny Perdue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonny_Perdue). He's been the United States Secretary of Agriculture since 2017 and has a big say in which areas are designated as wilderness (and therefore are protected by law).

 Ultimately it was all too much to do within the time alloted, but I liked the general idea so I decided to set up a prototype to get a sense of what this project could be.
